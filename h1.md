# HELSEC OCTOBER 2023 MEETUP - "What the BEC II - Invoice fraud and how it is done in the corporate world" by Elias Alanko (Presentation Summary)

During his presentation Elias Alanko, currently CISO at company 3stepIT, explained how invoice fraud happens in the corporate world and what controls can be implemented to prevent and detect it.  

Simplified description of how invoice fraud typically occurs:  
- Eve the criminal first of learns about the business relationship of Supplier and Customer companies, about Alice the employee of Customer company’s Finance team and Bob the employee of Supplier company’s Finance team by googling LinkedIn accounts of Customer and Supplier. She also learns how to register lookalike-domains for both companies.
- Eve the criminal sends an email from her Customer lookalike domain as Alice to Bob asking about open invoices.
- Bob doesn’t notice the fake domain and sends Eve the invoice details.
- Eve then sends an email from her Supplier lookalike domain as Bob to Alice asking for payment of certain invoice to a changed bank account by providing details of the invoice.
- Eve doesn’t notice the fake domain and transfers the funds to the bank account specified in the fraudulent invoice.
- Customer and Supplier notice discrepancies in their accounts and contact each other.
- At this point security, police and bank are contacted but the money is gone for good.
  
Controls that can help mitigate the risk of falling victim to invoice fraud:  
- Examples of warnings and fraud emails to post to Finance teams to inform personnel about the threats.
- Introduce processes to manage special situations such as payment account changes, overdue payment claims, etc.
- Make sure the company has crime insurance that is appropriate for company’s risks and is financially viable.

Global and Finnish statistics was also shared about the losses, and they were huge, in some cases reaching several tens of millions of Euros or several tens of billions of US Dollars. In certain cases, the criminals are caught and imprisoned for up to 20 years. In some other cases, the investigations are stopped due to challenges to identify suspects.
