# Summary of Chapter 1 Dive In and Threat Model! from Threat Modeling: Designing for Security by Adam Shostack
This chapter provides an introduction of threat modelling concept and explains how to build a threat model. It starts by highlighting the importance of proactively defining trust boundaries (which organization controls which part of the system) and thinking about security (what can go wrong in each trust boundary and within each part of the system) when designing a software system. Then it continues by presenting a systematic approach that helps to categorize and address different types of threats the system may face. The approach is divided into following steps:
1.	Identify threats.
   
The chapter suggests the STRIDE framework for identifying threats which stands for:
-	**Spoofing** is pretending to be something or someone you're not.
-	**Tampering** is modifying something you're not supposed to modify. It can include packets on the wire (or wireless), bits on disk, or the bits in memory.
-	**Repudiation** means claiming you didn't do something (regardless of whether you did or not).
-	**Denial of Service** are attacks designed to prevent a system from providing service, including by crashing it, making it unusably slow, or filling all its storage.
-	**Information Disclosure** is about exposing information to people who are not authorized to see it.
-	**Elevation of Privilege** is when a program or user is technically able to do things that they're not supposed to do.
   
(The above list of threats is copied from the book.)  

2.	Address each threat.
   
After the threats have been identified one should go through the list and think of how to address each of them, which can be done in four different ways:
-	**Mitigating threats** is about doing things to make it harder to take advantage of a threat.
-	**Eliminating threats** is almost always achieved by eliminating features.
-	**Transferring threats** is about letting someone or something else handle the risk.
-	**Accepting the risk** is the final approach to addressing threats. And once you've accepted the risk, you shouldn't worry about it. Sometimes worry is a sign that the risk hasn't been fully accepted, or that the risk acceptance was inappropriate.

(The above list of actions is copied from the book.) 

The chapter also lists detailed targets for each threat type and mitigation strategy and technique for each threat target.

3.	File bugs.
   
The book suggests to file a bug for each action identified to mitigate a threat target, and ensure to track, prioritize and implement them.

4.	Validate the threat model.
   
It should be ensured that each treat and related tests are checked, the system design diagram is updated as well as validated that the threat model corresponds to the system that is being built.

The chapter ends with instructions on how to make a threat model on your own.
