# Summary of subchapters "2.3 One-way Fuctions" and "2.4 One-Way Hash Functions" from Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms and Source Code in C by Bruce Schneier
- **One-way function:** mathematical operation that is easy to solve in one direction and hard in the opposite direction, e.i. given x it is easy to compute f(x), but given f(x) it is hard to compute x.
- **Trapdoor one-way function:** one-way function that is easy to compute in one direction and hard to compute in the other direction but it is also easy if you know the secret.
- **Hash function:** function for creating fixed-size representations (hashes) of variable-size data. Essential in cryptography.
- Good hash function is
  - one-way: definition above
  - collision-free: it is hard to generate two pre-images with the same hash value
  - public: there's no secret to the process and security is its one-wayness
-  **Message authentication code (MAC), also known as a data authentication code (DAC):** one-way hash function where hash value is calculated from both the pre-image and the key.

# Summary of Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited

List of commands to practice.

To get a hash that starts with 0 have to modify the input string until desired pattern is achieved.

Having a hash with specific pattern is related to Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm, which is used in blockchain networks and Bitcoin. During the mining phase of Proof of Work algorithm miners attempt to find a random number, which when combined with the block's data produces a hash value that corresponds certain pattern, such as a hash starting with certain number of leading zeros.

sha256sum hash for it:

Hash changes. And this time I got a hash with a leading zero with one try.

Seems there is issue with python libraries in my Debian VM, I searched for solutions, the ones I found required reinstalling python and pienv but that didn't work.
