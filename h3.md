# Summary of subchapters "2.3 One-way Fuctions" and "2.4 One-Way Hash Functions" from Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms and Source Code in C by Bruce Schneier
- **One-way function:** mathematical operation that is easy to solve in one direction and hard in the opposite direction, e.i. given x it is easy to compute f(x), but given f(x) it is hard to compute x.
- **Trapdoor one-way function:** one-way function that is easy to compute in one direction and hard to compute in the other direction but it is also easy if you know the secret.
- **Hash function:** function for creating fixed-size representations (hashes) of variable-size data. Essential in cryptography.
- Good hash function is
  - one-way: definition above
  - collision-free: it is hard to generate two pre-images with the same hash value
  - public: there's no secret to the process and security is its one-wayness
-  **Message authentication code (MAC), also known as a data authentication code (DAC):** one-way hash function where hash value is calculated from both the pre-image and the key.
